    "In Python, exceptions are used to handle errors and exceptional situations in a program. \n",
    "While Python provides a set of built-in exception classes to cover common errors, \n",
    "there are situations where you might need to create your own custom exceptions to\n",
    "handle specific cases unique to your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating custom exceptions in Python, it is recommended to subclass the built-in \n",
    "`Exception` class or one of its subclasses. Here are some reasons for using the `Exception` \n",
    "class or its subclasses when creating custom exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consistent Exception Hierarchy:\n",
    "   - In Python, exceptions form a hierarchy, with the base class being `BaseException`,\n",
    "and specific exception classes inheriting from it. The built-in `Exception` class is a direct\n",
    "subclass of `BaseException`. When you create custom exceptions by subclassing `Exception`, \n",
    "you maintain consistency within the exception hierarchy. This makes it easier for developers to understand and work with your custom exceptions in a similar way to built-in exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compatibility with Catching Mechanisms:\n",
    "   - Python allows you to catch exceptions based on their types.\n",
    "When you use the `Exception` class or its subclasses, you can catch\n",
    "your custom exceptions using a `try-except` block specifically targeting your exception type.\n",
    "This ensures that your exception is caught and handled appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # some code that may raise your custom exception\n",
    "   except YourCustomException as e:\n",
    "       # handle the exception\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. voiding Ambiguity:\n",
    "   - Subclassing `Exception` helps avoid ambiguity when dealing with exceptions. \n",
    "If you create custom exceptions without subclassing, it might be challenging \n",
    "to distinguish between your exceptions and other exceptions in the code. \n",
    "Subclassing provides a clear and distinct type for your exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Enhanced Readability and Documentation:\n",
    "   - By using the `Exception` class or its subclasses, you provide clear information to \n",
    "other developers about the purpose of your exception. This enhances the readability of \n",
    "your code and serves as documentation for how your exceptions should be used and handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while you can technically create custom exceptions without subclassing from \n",
    "`Exception`, doing so helps maintain consistency, compatibility, and clarity in your code. \n",
    "It aligns with established Python conventions and best practices for exception handling."

    "Q-6:Error handling is a critical aspect of writing robust\n",
    "and maintainable Python code. Here are some best practices\n",
    "for error handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use Specific Exceptions:\n",
    "   - Catch specific exceptions rather than using a broad `except` clause. \n",
    "    This allows you to handle different types of errors \n",
    "    in different ways and provides more information in case of an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # some code that may raise a specific exception\n",
    "    except SpecificException as e:\n",
    "        # handle the specific exception\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Avoid Bare Excepts:\n",
    "   - Avoid using a bare `except` clause as it catches all exceptions, \n",
    "making it difficult to identify and debug issues. Always specify the \n",
    "exception types you expect to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Avoid this:\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # some code\n",
    "    except:\n",
    "        # handle any exception\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Prefer this:\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # some code\n",
    "    except SpecificException as e:\n",
    "        # handle the specific exception\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use `finally` for Cleanup:\n",
    "   - Use the `finally` block for code that must be executed\n",
    "whether an exception occurs or not. This is useful for cleanup operations such \n",
    "as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # some code\n",
    "    except SpecificException as e:\n",
    "        # handle the specific exception\n",
    "    finally:\n",
    "        # cleanup code, always executed\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Logging Exceptions:\n",
    "   - Use the `logging` module to log exceptions rather than printing them. \n",
    "Logging provides a more flexible and configurable way to handle errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # some code\n",
    "    except SpecificException as e:\n",
    "        logging.error(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Handle Exceptions Locally:\n",
    "   - Handle exceptions as close to the point of occurrence as possible.\n",
    "This makes the code more readable and helps in identifying the cause of the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def example_function():\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            # some code that may raise an exception\n",
    "        except SpecificException as e:\n",
    "            # handle the specific exception locally\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Custom Exceptions:\n",
    "   - Define custom exception classes when appropriate. \n",
    "This can make your code more expressive and help distinguish\n",
    "different types of errors in a meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # some code\n",
    "    except CustomError as e:\n",
    "        # handle the custom exception\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Raise Exceptions Appropriately:\n",
    "   - Raise exceptions when a function cannot complete its task successfully. \n",
    "Provide informative error messages to aid in debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def divide_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "        if b == 0:\n",
    "            raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
    "        return a / b\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Use `assert` for Debugging:**\n",
    "   - Use the `assert` statement for debugging purposes.\n",
    "    It helps in catching programming errors early during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    assert condition, \"Error message if condition is False\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Handle Multiple Exceptions:**\n",
    "   - If multiple exceptions need to be handled in the same way, \n",
    "    you can catch them as a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # some code\n",
    "    except (ExceptionType1, ExceptionType2) as e:\n",
    "        # handle both types of exceptions\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Understand the Exception Hierarchy:**\n",
    "    - Be aware of the Python exception hierarchy and choose the\n",
    "    appropriate base class for custom exceptions.\n",
    "\n"
